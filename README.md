project code for game site and games
Project Name:		SmileNLearn by Py
Project Concept:	The goal would be to create a few games that can be used as a pass time in the classroom or at home for elementary students. All games would be located on the SmilenLearn site page.******
(Will need assistance on site page)
	This games would encourage students to exercise their brains without extensive thinking or stress. 
Project Games:
    1.	Memory – two of each symbol is covered by a colored box, it is the goal of the user to pair up each symbol. While uncovering the symbols, if they match, the symbols are eft uncovered. The goal is to uncover all symbols.
    2.	Number Slide - 4x4 grid with a certain amount of tiles are in a box, the users goal is to place the back in numerical order, after being mixed up.
    3.	Tetris – game of differently shaped blocks, made up of four tiny boxes, guided down to make complete rows… until no more blocks can fit on the screen.
Making the Games my Own:
    1.	I am going to adapt the templates I have seen to fit a more child-friendly / elementary audience.
      a.	Not as many boxes
    2.	Adapt it to what students may be learning at that age
      a.	Different number counts for the number slide
          i.	Ex. 10, 20, 30, 40 
          ii.	5, 10, 15, 20
       b.	Possible matching colors with the words, or shapes with the name of the shape (if I am able)
People Needed:	Can be done with just 1 and assistance when needed from the professor.
